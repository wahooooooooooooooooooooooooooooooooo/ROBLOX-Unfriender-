# rblx unfriender

A small JavaScript script that will automatically remove every friend from your Roblox account.  
I made this because Roblox doesnâ€™t provide any bulk unfriend option and clicking hundreds (or thousands) of times gets old fast.

## how it works

- grabs ur userid
- gets ur friends with roblox api
- grabs ur crsf token to unfriend
- unfriends
- will print who it removed and how many

## how to use

1. log into [roblox.com](https://www.roblox.com)
2. press f12 and go into console
3. paste `main.js` into console and enter
4. removes ur friends
